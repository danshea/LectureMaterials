    "### Section 1 - Variables and assignments\n",
    "Variables may be thought of the same way we think of them in Mathematics, as a representation of some value. The difference here is that we are not only concerned with numbers, but with any of the other things that we encounter within the Python language itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To assign a value to a variable, we use the following syntax:  \n",
    "`x = 1`  \n",
    "Here, the value on the left side of the equals sign is referred to as the `lvalue` and the value on the right side is the `rvalue`.  \n",
    "We are assigning the value of `1` to the variable `x`.  \n",
    "Below, we will illustrate some of the assignments possible in Python, and introduce of of the `types` that data may come from."

    "In the above examples, notice that the number `1` is an `int`, which is short for Integer, that is the set of numbers you would apply when counting objects or dealing with things that are not fractional.  The second example contains the abbreviated value of $\\pi$, `3.14`, and is of type `float`. This is short for floating-point and without delving too deeply into floating point numbers and computing, we can for the time being just think of them as numbers we would use when dealing with things that may resolve to fractional values, such a `1/2` which would return `0.5` (see the discussion of arithmetic operations below). The last example is my name, but it could be any text that we may encounter and it is of type `str`, which is short for String. During this course, we will encounter more types, but for now let's stick with these three and examine arithmetic operators.\n",
