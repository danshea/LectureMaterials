# LectureMaterials
Lecture materials that I am creating to cover simple data structures.  
You are free to use these materials as long as you inform me that you are using them.  
The goal of this repository is to create lecture materials in the form of Jupyter Notebooks to teach fundamental programming and data science skills to students in the Biological Sciences. My PhD is in Agriculture, but my background is in Computer Science (B.S.E.) and Bioinformatics (MSc.) and my thesis was on the development and application of bioinformatic algorithms in the breeding and genetic analysis of interspecific hybrids in _Brassica_.

I will try to update this repository regularly with new materials, but _caveat emptor_ as nobody is paying me to do this and this repo and 10 cents will get you a 10 cent cup of coffee.
