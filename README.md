# LectureMaterials
The purpose of these workbooks is to create an introductory course that covers
the use of Python for scientific data analysis. It does not intend to replace a
more formal Computer Science Data Structures & Algorithms course. However, data
structures are examined using simple implementations of more commonly used data
structures, and as the materials a produced, the aim is to illustrate how these
structures may be used in the analysis of scientific data.

I will try to update this repository regularly with new materials, but
_caveat emptor_, this repo and 10 cents will get you a 10 cent cup of coffee.

My academic background is in Computer Science (B.S.E.), Bioinformatics (MSc.),
and the application of computation towards solving biological problems of
interest in Agriculture (PhD).
